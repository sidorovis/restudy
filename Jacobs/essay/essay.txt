	My interest to exact sciences appeared in the sixth grade, when I was pupil at school #1 in Grodno. At that time place of math teacher took Evgenij Petrovich Kolesnikov. He constantly taught us to solve tasks using various ways and using abstract thinking. I remember his method to solve several cases of linear equations systems using Euler-Venn diagrams. That was awesome, and it looked like a trick or a miracle. That year I participated at school math competition first time. From sixth grade I had started to take part at different olympiads in exact sciences. At seventh and eighth grades, I took part at regional math competition.
	Upon admission to the eighth grade, I had passed math exam and continued my studies in mathematics-informatics class. That year our class were taught course Computer Science for Beginners. The course contained a lot of interesting and useful information. We was studied the simplest sorting algorithms, search algorithms, combinatorial methods. At that time it was really exciting, because teachers always gave real and interesting problems: for example, find out a password to an archive, write a chat using synchronized access to a file on one computer. Such problems gave us energy and interest in the algorithmic techniques. In high school I met a lot of talented guys, who subsequently took place at different levels in various competitions. With the help of our teacher, Arkady V. Lomakin, we organized large team of people, who interested into informatics olympiads. Arkady V. was held local competitions every week, this competitions were very interesting and we participated in them with great desire.
	In eighth grade I got a diploma of the third degree at the olympics in informatics and was invited to the camp "Science". This camp designed for talented pupils from the Grodno Region. During 3 weeks, six times a week, pupils attend classes on the chosen subjects (eg. mathematics, physics). At that camp, I finally realized, that I am fond of computer science. There I wrote my first graphical game "shooter". It was really awesome. That year we diligently studied the theory of graphs including structure, classification, storage methods, the corresponding algorithms.
	That knowledge became an important component for admission into 10th form without exams. Tenth and eleventh grades became basis for university entrance. During studying in these grades, we had been studied solving equations methods, numeral systems, various geometrical problems, dynamic programming. It was the most amazing school years. I remember very well, when university professor gave me advice to program ant colony algorithm for solving the traveling salesman problem. I looked how this algorithm finds a fairly good solution for a few seconds.
	During 10th and 11-th grade, I got first grade diploma in computer science at the regional competitions. That's why I was not  worried about entrance exams to university. I decided to go to Artificial Intelligence speciality at the Belarusian State University Informatics and Radio-electronics. University taught me that correct approach to education is fully learn the material, does not expect to get information from some booklets, read books carefully and slowly. The most interesting of courses were: hardware and software networks, computational linguistics and natural language interface, programming languages, logical foundations of intelligent systems, parallel knowledge processing, neural network models, image processing, decision-making systems, probability theory, physics. These courses contain lab work, which were very useful for gaining practical experience in programming of complex, interrelated systems. While studying at first and second course of university, I had prepared school pupils for national competitions in informatics, during regional winter training camp and during summer "Science" camp. Also I was participant of informatics contest at the University.
	Beginning with the third course, I have started to work at the "EPAM Systems" company. In this company, I usually perform tasks that connected with optimization of data storage, retrieval of memory leaks, creation of additional modules to trading systems, etc. During this work, I have tried to explore and use many different tools and techniques in software development.
	After receiving a graduate degree in BSUIR, I'd like to learn more about exact sciences to find the problem, which will puzzled me for a long time. I think, it is necessary to get an education at the university, which works closely in the international community. I know few Jacobs University students, they were my mates at school, Vitaly Bashko, Sergei Kurilo and Mikulich Eugene. I was talking with them and felt an interest in getting education at Jacobs University.
	Jacobs have more diverse technical hardware base, so I can get new theoretical and practical knowledge in robotics, machine learning algorithms, semantic networks, etc. I believe that learning and if it is possible, working at this university, will be the most appropriate and logical extension of my development. Thus, I am very interested in getting admission and financial support to the level of "Master" at "Smart Systems".
